## ✨ The Vision: Healthcare, Simplified

In today's world, patients often struggle with complex medical jargon and feel disconnected from their care providers. Doctors, in turn, are overwhelmed by administrative tasks and a high volume of cases, making it difficult to prioritize who needs attention most.

**MediHub solves this.** We empower patients with clarity and control over their health journey, and we equip doctors with the intelligent tools needed to provide efficient, proactive, and data-driven care.
